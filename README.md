# Socialcops Task
Synchronizing the contents of two folders on different devices using Dropbox API.

## About
There are two scripts, both of which run continuously to constantly sync the data between the two folders.
Whenever any modifications occur on one of the folders, the script is triggered and it uploads the files onto dropbox and the other script runs periodically to check for any changes and incorporates them accordingly.
